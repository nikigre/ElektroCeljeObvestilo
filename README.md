# ElektroCeljeObvestilo
This project was quickly bodged together. If code is a bit slow, ugly it is because of that. üòù So don't judge me.
It was mainly created to see how [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) works.

## What is this project about?
I hate when the power goes out. At home, I have a few appliaances, that need to be online 24/7. So I decided to create a service, that would check the website of the Electrical supply company and check if my address is on the list for maintenance (so that the power would go out). The code checks the website every day. And if it finds my address on the list, it sends me an SMS via [SMSsederAPI](https://github.com/nikigre/SMSsenderAPI).

Any user can subscribe to the service [here](https://nikigre.si/sl/izpadi-elektrike-elektra-celje/) and get notifications about power outages.
